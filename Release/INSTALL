Basic Installation
==================

   The "configure" shell script attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent variables used during 
compilation.  It uses those values to create a "Makefile" in each directory of the package. Finally, it creates a 
shell script "config.status" that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file 
"config.cache" that saves the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing 
compiler output (useful mainly for debugging "configure").

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try to figure out how `configure' could check 
whether to do them, and mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can be considered for 
the next release. If at some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

1. "cd" to the directory containing the package's source code and type "./configure" to configure the package for your 
system. Running `configure' can take a while.  While running, it prints some messages telling which features it is 
checking for.

2. Type "make" to compile the package.

3. Optionally, type `make check' to run the package self-tests.

4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and documentation.

5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source code directory by typing "make clean". To also 
remove the files that "configure" created (so you can compile the package for a different kind of computer), type 
"make distclean"

Configure Options
==================

-h / -? / --help 		| Print this message
-v / --version			| Display the program version
-c FILE / --cache-file=FILE 	| Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of the default "config.cache"
-q / --quiet			| Disable test results. Equivalent to "-c /dev/null"
-s / --silent			| Disable all output.
-p PATH / --prefix=PATH		| "make install" installs files to PATH rather than the root directory
